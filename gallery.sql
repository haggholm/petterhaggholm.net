Slowly, amidst\nthe distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began\nto churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that\ncharnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the\nstars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing\nship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great\nCthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with\nvast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency.\n</p>\n<footer>H.P. Lovecraft, <cite title="The Call of Cthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nAn experiment with applying ink with a brush, which I had done\nonly once before, and never to detailed work. Details were\nenhanced with pens. My drawing was based, naturally enough, on\nLovecraft’s description of Cthulhu:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nA pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body\nwith rudimentary wings … It represented a monster of\nvaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose\nface was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body,\nprodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings\nbehind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and\nunnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence …\n</p>\n<footer>Ibid.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<em>Some</em> of the reasons my Cthulhu looks a bit unlike a lot\nof depictions have to do with paying attention to that: Note\n<q><em>rudimentary</em> wings</q>, for instance, and <q>bloated\ncorpulence</q>.\n</p>', E'Ink.'),

('dread_sentry.jpg', E'gallery/thumbnails/dread_sentry.jpg', E'Dread Sentry', E'<p>\nThe Dread Sentry is vaguely inspired by a death knight in a\nplanned RPG campaign of my own design (that may or may not ever\nget off the ground). It was drawn in two classes; sketched in\none and fleshed out in another.

('wizard.png', E'gallery/thumbnails/wizard.png', E'Black Magic', E'<p>\nA dark wizard hard at work; I''m not sure what he’s brewing, but\nI’m reasonably certain it''s both more potent and more malicious\nthan your average witch’s brew.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis picture was drawn as a (very belated) Christmas gift for\nmy good friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheepeeh">Sheepy</a>,\nwho is in possession of the original (and who scanned it for\nme after my scan mysteriously disappeared), for which reason I\nput more effort into the details than I normally do (though\nunfortunately, many of those details are somewhat too small\nto show up well at this resolution). She requested something\nrepresentative of what I like to draw:\n<q>Goblins and eyeballs and stuff</q>—voilà!\n</p>\n<p>\nOther than a horrible mistake in inking, mostly covered up\n(but still present and as you see it), I''m rather pleased with\nit.

We had just been introduced to\nthe basics of gesture drawing, and I felt like applying what\nI percieved to be the central concept to something more free\nand fun, drawn from my head, not life.

Only the\nhood was in marginally good shape, frayed around the edges\nbut whole enough to conceal most of the Harbinger’s\nfeatures. He could see a flash of pale skin, though; its\nchin, open to the light, was a deathly white, as were its\nthin lips. Finally giving up it hissed softly, flashing a\nset of white fangs, and stalked off in the brush.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nOmen, the First Harbinger, is one of the most mysterious and\nresourceful servants of the sorcerer Nekros, a product of\nthe Necromancer’s twisted magic.
